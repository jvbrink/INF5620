Files:

wave2D.py - Contains the problem, solver and plotter classes for the wave problem.

gaussianPeak.py - Shows a simple use of the solver classes, plots a simple wave and its time development. The results have been animated (see gaussian_damping.mpg and gaussian_no_damping.mpg)

test_constantSolution.py - Reproduces a constant solution to machine precision and implements a nose test.

test_separableSolution.py - Reproduces a separable solution to machine precision and implements a nose test.

subsea_hill.py - Shows how the solver class can be used to solve the physical problem of the tsunami over a subsea hill. This program is not finished and so is not functional.
