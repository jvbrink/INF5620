 * You have written an extensive tex report, very good, but it was not required. Results are 
   correct.
 * Very good class based implementation.
 * Ok use of docstrings, some more general comments would be good.
 * Some things could have been done easier using less code. Remember DRY principle.
 * In general everything looks good!

Approved.
